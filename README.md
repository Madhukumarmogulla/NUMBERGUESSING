# NUMBERGUESSING
* This is one of the simple python projects yet an exciting one. You can even call it a mini-game. 
* Make a program in which the computer randomly chooses a number between 1 to 10, 1 to 100, or any range. 
* Then give users a hint to guess the number. Every time the user guesses wrong, he gets another clue, and his score gets reduced. 
* The clue can be multiples, divisible, greater or smaller, or a combination of all.
* You will also need functions to compare the inputted number with the guessed number, to compute the difference between the two, and to check whether an actual number was inputted or not in this python project!.
* User inputs the lower bound and upper bound of the range.
* The compiler generates a random integer between the range and store it in a variable for future references.
* For repetitive guessing, a while loop will be initialized.
* If the user guessed a number which is greater than a randomly selected number, the user gets an output “Try Again! You guessed too high“
* Else If the user guessed a number which is smaller than a randomly selected number, the user gets an output “Try Again! You guessed too small”
And if the user guessed in a minimum number of guesses, the user gets a “Congratulations! ” Output.
* Else if the user didn’t guess the integer in the minimum number of guesses, he/she will get “Better Luck Next Time!” output.
